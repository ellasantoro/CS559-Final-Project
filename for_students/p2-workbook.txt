[X] correct P2 Canvas Assignment submission [none]: 
[X] clear explanations in p2-workbook.txt [none]: 
[X] correct P2G Canvas Assignment submission on time [none]: 
[X] program runs (or seems to run correctly - worth looking at error console) [final-grtown]: 
[X] frame rate seems OK (not too slow) [final-grtown]: 
[X] UI is there and seems to work (can lookat and ride) [final-grtown]:
[X] highlight list looks OK [final-grtown]: Lookat list is VERY crowded, but my highlight list is clean.
[X] visually distinct from example [final-grtown]: 
[X] theme makes sense (need explanation) [final-grtown]: My town is a medieval town. If unfamiliar, google has some great images with it!
[X] cool theme bonus (need explanation) [final-grtown]: I think my theme is pretty cool and I had a lot of fun designing things and making sure everything fits in cohesively.
[X] objects created for this assignment 1, not trivial, can be identified in world (need explanation) [final-grtown]: House style 2 (medievalbuilding.js)
[X] objects created for this assignment 2, not trivial, can be identified in world (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Clock tower (clocktower.js)
[X] 5 more kinds of objects 1, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: House style 1 (medievalhouse.js)
[X] 5 more kinds of objects 2, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Castle (castle.js)
[X] 5 more kinds of objects 3, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Windmill (windmill.js)
[X] 5 more kinds of objects 4, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Carriage (carriage.js)
[X] 5 more kinds of objects 5, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: House Style 3 (medievalstructure.js)
[X] has building, natural, vehicle (need explanation) [final-grtown]: all 3 types can be found in the folders with the names "natural", "buildings", and "vehicles". For natural I have trees, wheat, and flowers,
    for buildings I have clocktower, 3 house styles, windmill, and castle, and for vehicle I have a boat and a carriage
[X] loaded model (need explanation) [final-grtown]: used GLTF loader for market stall and for trees
[X] shader: identifiable and not trivial (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Lake shader (this is my advanced shader, Professor Wu said I could use it for both my basic and advanced pts)
[X] three behaviors you made 1, not trivial, can be identified in scene (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Crows flying in a path in the sky and having movement that makes them look like they are flying
[X] three behaviors you made 2, not trivial, can be identified in scene (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Clocktower - minute and hourhand work like a clock, when the hour hits the top, a bell raises out from the top, begins ringing for a few 
    seconds, and then lowers until it hits the top again (please note that when it makes a half rotation it looks like it hits the top, but it needs to make a FULL rotation for the bell to come up).
[X] three behaviors you made 3, not trivial, can be identified in scene (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Boat traveling across the lake and turning around smoothly if it hits a corner
[X] at least one object is rideable / followable [final-grtown]: Boat can be ridden
[X] behavior that is not simple (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Clocktower behavior is not simple and requires many different aspects to make sure it works smoothly with time elapsed and to use tolerance to ensure the bell can be raised
[X] articulated figure (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Windmill - smaller white wings rotate relative to the wooden sticks (Professor Wu said on piazza this counts for basic points even with only 2 degrees of freedom)
[X] advanced thing 1: has a challenge type (need the name and number from the list) [final-grtown]: Name: Particle System, Number: 4 ; I have "pixie" dust type particles that can be found in my particles folder.
[X] advanced thing 1: works properly, can be identified in the town (need explanation) [final-grtown]: I believe it works properly as it looks visually like pixie dust or fairy particles floating around
[ ] advanced thing 1: points above and beyond (need explanation) [final-grtown]: 
[X] advanced thing 2: has a challenge type (need the name and number from the list) [final-grtown]: Name: Animated Shader Effect, Number: 5 ; I made a flowing water shader for my lake
[X] advanced thing 2: works properly, can be identified in the town (need explanation) [final-grtown]: I believe it works properly because with the moving lighting it looks as though it is flowing water even though it oscillates back and forth using an image.
[ ] advanced thing 2: points above and beyond (need explanation) [final-grtown]: 
[ ] advanced thing 3: has a challenge type (need the name and number from the list) [final-grtown]: 
[ ] advanced thing 3: works properly, can be identified in the town (need explanation) [final-grtown]: 
[ ] advanced thing 3: points above and beyond (need explanation) [final-grtown]: 
[ ] advanced thing 4: has a challenge type (need the name and number from the list) [final-grtown]: 
[ ] advanced thing 4: works properly, can be identified in the town (need explanation) [final-grtown]: 
[ ] advanced thing 4: points above and beyond (need explanation) [final-grtown]: 
[ ] advanced thing 5: has a challenge type (need the name and number from the list) [final-grtown]: 
[ ] advanced thing 5: works properly, can be identified in the town (need explanation) [final-grtown]: 
[ ] advanced thing 5: points above and beyond (need explanation) [final-grtown]:
